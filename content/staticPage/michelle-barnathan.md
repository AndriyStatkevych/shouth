Michelle Barnathan, LMHC joined the clinical team at South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center in 2015 after many years of working within the educational system as a school counselor.  Michelle completed her Bachelor’s degree in Psychology at Adelphi University and went on to earn both a Master’s degree in School Counseling, from Long Island University – CW Post, as well as an advanced certificate in Mental Health Counseling from the University of Buffalo.  

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one o

f the most common mental disorders that develop in children. Children and young adults with ADHD have impaired functioning in all areas of life: school/work, home and social. If untreated, the disorder can have long-term adverse effects into adolescence and adulthood.  As a Licensed Mental Health Counselor specializing in adolescents, teenagers and young adults, Michelle draws on her extensive background working both inside and outside of the classroom.  With her knowledge of special programs and accommodations available, she pairs accordingly with students who find themselves struggling with learning, behavioral and academic performance.

With use of cognitive behavioral therapy and study skills training, patients learn to develop structure and skills to help them stay focused and face their challenges.  Michelle works directly with the client to support them in their steps to achieve their goals, as well as the parents and families, helping them learn to set boundaries, manage conflict, and motivate positivity. 

Michelle works closely with Dr. Fruitman to diagnose and treat our patients with a combination of counseling and medication management when necessary. Our interventions are uniquely customized to identify the needs of each individual patient with the care and appropriate means to succeed while including the parents and school system. 

Adolescence is a challenging time for any student, adjusting to life at this age can be tough on any student but can be more challenging for a student diagnosed with ADHD.  Students with ADHD are equally capable at being successful as a student without this diagnosis.   Our goal is to bridge the gap between the school system and support system at home in order to help the student achieve success.
