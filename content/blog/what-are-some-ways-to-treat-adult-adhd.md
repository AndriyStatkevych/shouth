For anyone with diagnosed adult ADHD, or anyone who suspects they have it, the effects of this sometimes debilitating condition will be well documented. Basically, suffers from adult ADHD can’t be still for long, always on the go, and every day is a struggle to remain calm, keep order, organize daily tasks, and get where they need to be, when they need to be there.


Thankfully help is at hand at South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center in Long Island, through various means that are tailored to the specific person.


For a non-suffer, handling finances is a generally easy thing – yes it might make you cry slightly at your very low bank balance, when you would quite like a bursting rich one, but on the whole, it’s easy to manage. Take an adult ADHD sufferer, and the reality is very different. Organizing and paying bills on time can be difficult, which leads to a vicious circle of not meeting financial commitments, which then makes the sufferer feel down, and depression and anxiety can set in.


This vicious circle needs to be taken into hand, gaining control, through various methods, such as counselling, medications, meditation, and small, easy to remember methods, such as preparation in the morning, arranging everything need for the day the night before, talking yourself through things – these are all ways to handle the condition, and gain control back, so it doesn’t take over a sufferer’s life.


Adult ADHD should not define a person, it is simply a condition that they happen to have, and when help is sought, methods put into place, and recognition given, nobody need live a life devoid of control and happiness.


If you feel you need help, if you’re unsure whether you have the condition and have an inkling that you may, call our helpful staff today, who will discuss your symptoms and needs, and put together a tailor-made treatment plan just for you.
