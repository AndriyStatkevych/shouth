Why is ADHD so Frustrating?

It’s frustrating because so many people don’t realize they have it. From running late on a regular basis to forgetting to pay bills, becoming irritated easily to being scatty with certain tasks, these are just a few of the regular problems with adult ADHD.

Of course, many people tend to falsely think that ADHD only affects children, but that’s simply not the case. ADHD can be an adult condition also, and the fact that adults have to pay bills, work, look after high responsibility tasks, makes adult ADHD very damaging when not controlled and managed. The fact that so many people don’t realize they have the condition creates an even bigger problem.

It’s this simple - once you know what a problem is, you can put mechanisms in place to solve it. When you don’t know what is wrong, you simply amble along thinking that what you’re going through is normal, or really not knowing what the issue is.

Adult ADHD cannot be cured but it can be managed, and we offer a range of treatment options to make life infinitely easier. If you don’t know about these treatment methods and management routes, your life is basically going to be chaotic. For someone in a relationship with a person with adult ADHD, or someone living with a person touched by the condition, the fact that you can clearly see something is wrong, but you have no idea what is equally as frustrating.

The bottom line is that reaching out is the single best way to ensure that your route towards treatment is a smooth one. From there, you can also look forward to a life which isn’t damaged by the condition’s uncontrolled elements.

Here at South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center we have years of experience of dealing with adult ADHD and we have several treatment options we can discuss with you. Every person is different and that means that one size doesn’t fit all. By arranging a consultation with one of our highly experienced staff, you can find the way out of frustration.
