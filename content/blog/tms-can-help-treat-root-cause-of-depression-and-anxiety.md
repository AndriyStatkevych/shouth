Dr. Edward Fruitman, Medical Director of South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center offers innovative genetically based treatment options for Depression and Anxiety. At South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center we offer a simple test that gives insight into our patients’ specific genetic profile which enables Dr. Fruitman to optimize medication regimen and/or offer alternative treatment options.

Recent studies suggest that early life experiences in combination with genetic predispositions are major contributors to treatment resistant anxiety and depression.  The amygdala is a region of the brain responsible for emotion regulation while the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is responsible for emotion processing. Fear inducing cues increase amygdala activity and cause the physiological responses to anxiety. The PFC regulates the amygdala effect by inhibiting autonomic and endocrine responses to stressors. In essence, the PFC controls the extent of an emotional response. Individuals that experience heightened anxiety and depressive symptoms are shown to have an inability to control and habituate responses to stressors.  Studies suggest that genetic factors may contribute to this effect. Researchers found that in “subjects carrying a substituted methionine in the BDNF gene, fear doesn’t extinguish as readily in response to repeated nonthreatening cues; in those with a valine, it extinguishes more easily. Using neuroimaging, the authors showed that polymorphism carriers exhibited more amygdala and less PFC activity with subsequent cue presentations.”  In these individuals the PFC is dormant and individuals may not respond to psychotherapy or medication.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy (TMS) is a noninvasive treatment option for individuals suffering from treatment resistant anxiety and depression.  TMS stimulates the PFC using noninvasive magnetic energy, which over time provides relief to depression and anxiety symptoms. Dr. Edward Fruitman is the pioneer provider of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Therapy in the Five Towns area. Dr. Fruitman has successfully treated patients suffering from anxiety and depression with TMS since 2010.
