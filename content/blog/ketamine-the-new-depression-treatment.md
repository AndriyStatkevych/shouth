Depression comes in various forms. For some, it can manifest into sensations of feeling down and hopeless, but may pass within a short space of time. For others, it may be a much longer lasting effect, requiring help in the form of anti-depressant drugs to control symptoms and recover. However, for some individuals, depression can be much more debilitating and can affect one’s quality of life drastically. For these individuals, anti-depressant drugs simply may not work. Additionally, anti-depressants are also known for taking their time to kick in, and after a while, certain sufferers may see no benefit.


This is where other treatments come into play, and can have a drastic and positive effect on day to day life and one’s overall state of mind.


Ketamine or Special K is a well-known recreational drug, however when used in the properly prescribed manner, can be hugely beneficial for depression sufferers.


A recent survey attempted to measure the effectiveness of Ketamine for depression treatment; the findings showed that this powerful substance can offer hope and positive results for many individuals who have struggled to find a treatment that works for them.

A study by the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, as well as the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has shown that within a 24 hour time period, out of 73 patients with severe and major depression, a quarter noticed a temporary reduction in the severity of their depressive symptoms. That is a huge amount, and offers much hope for many individuals looking for ways to improve their overall quality of life.
