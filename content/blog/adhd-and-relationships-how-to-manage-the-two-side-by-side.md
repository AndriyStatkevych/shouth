When it comes to relationships, we have enough problems to deal with without factoring in other issues, such as health and behavior.

or any couple dealing with ADHD as a part of their day to day relationship life, small problems can become increasingly difficult, depending upon the severity of the symptoms.


So how can we stop ADHD becoming a ruining factor in relationships? And how can we learn to deal with the reality of symptom management?


The first port of call is to identify symptoms and problems, and understand how they are affecting a relationship. For instance, if one partner has the condition, and the other doesn’t, then the partner without symptoms may struggle to understand the behavior and reactions of the person suffering. This can lead to resentment and loneliness, which don’t help a relationship at the best of times.


If both partners have ADHD, then you could be looking at a communication stumbling block, and plentiful arguments and disagreements.


Understanding that this isn’t a reflection on you is important in order to accept the challenges ahead. Once you know this, you can look forward in a more positive manner.


Hyper-focus can be one of those things that affects a relationship connected with ADHD. Sufferers tend to be all or nothing in the early stages of dating, and as time moves on, and things progress, the sufferer almost seems to lose interest, or that’s how it seems to the other person anyway. In reality, this isn’t the problem at all, and it’s simply a symptom of ADHD.The key here is to work on maintaining a connection and working on intimacy, to keep both parties happy.


Another issue can be the ‘walking on egg shells’ feeling, whereby one partner can feel like they’re always doing something wrong, and arguments abound. Again, it’s important to recognize that it’s the condition doing this, and not that there is anything particularly wrong underlying. This is a common issue which rears its head in ADHD affected relationships, and one that is easily managed once recognized.



Basically ADHD matters, and it’s important to realize this fact, and not just brush it under the carpet and think it will go away. A proper assessment, treatment and management will make relationships easier to manage, and when both parties understand the challenges ahead, there’s no reason why a happy, healthy, and successful relationship can’t be maintained.
