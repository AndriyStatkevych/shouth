## Ketamine Injections in Long island NY for Treatment Resistant Depression:

**Overview**

Ketamine is a novel treatment option for people who traditional treatments for depression such as antidepressants or psychotherapy have been ineffective. When administered at low doses, ketamine has been reliably shown to be effective at alleviating symptoms of depression. Furthermore, ketamine is fast-acting – studies have shown patients that respond can feel better in just 1-2 treatments, compared to antidepressants which can take 4 or more weeks to start working. Dr. Fruitman and the staff at South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center are experienced in ketamine administration, and are committed to working with you to find a treatment that provides lasting relief. 

We personalize every single treatment plan to your needs and medical history. If after two sessions you do not experience improvement from your depressive symptoms, we discontinue treatment and reevaluate your treatment options.

Many patients who were previously unsuccessful in treating their depression have found success with ketamine, especially as a bridge to oral medication. The goals of the treatment are rapid recovery, stabilization, and maintenance of therapeutic effect. Ketamine maintenance is possible, if absolutely necessary.



## How does Ketamine work?

The exact mechanism of how Ketamine works for depression is not fully known. Ketamine works on a neurotransmitter system called Glutamate (NMDA receptors), which is the most widespread neurotransmitter in the brain. Many major research institutions are conducting trials and studies on this subject. The public clinical results are excellent, but the mechanism of action still remains a mystery.

## Is Ketamine safe?

Ketamine has been widely used as an anesthetic for minor procedures since the 1960’s. In many countries, it is used by the first aid response workers when dealing with minor trauma. The safety of Ketamine is such that it can be used as an outpatient anesthetic by non-physicians. The dose used to Depression is about one quarter (1/4) of the anesthetic dose. At South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center, we administer a trial injection, followed in 15 minutes by a regular injection. This will minimize the chance of any negative reaction and help to reassure the patient. Ketamine has a very short-acting, mind-altering effect that is frequently described as a mild alcohol intoxication. The effects of ketamine lasts for less than two hours.

Negative effects of Ketamine use are most often associated with high chronic doses of Veterinary grade by recreational drug users (Special K) or medical errors. Ketamine is an FDA approved substance, but does not carry an indication for depression treatment.

## How does South Shore use Ketamine for Treatment Resistant Depression?

Appropriate patients are selected by the medical team. EKG, vital signs and oxygen saturation are monitored prior to and during treatment. During a treatment session, patient is given two injections, 10-15 minutes apart. The patient is awake but feels mildly intoxicated for under two hours. Usually, patients report the subjective experience of Ketamine-induced state as pleasant. The patient is expected to stay at our facility for a period of two hours during the procedure. Following treatment, patient is discharged fully awake, oriented and sober.

## South Shore treatment philosophy:

We individualize treatment to the particular patient. Lamictal treatment is frequently used as an adjunctive treatment, to both improve efficacy and reduce potential side effects. We charge for each session separately, since we are unable to predict how many treatments would be necessary. At South Shore Neuropsychiatric in Hewlett Long Island, we try to make the patient a full partner in his/her treatment process.

## What to expect from Ketamine Injection treatment for treatment resistant depression:

Expect a very pleasant experience. It is reasonable to expect improvement within 24 hours of the treatment. Normally, treatments would occur twice a week for the initial two weeks and once weekly after that. We typically expect patients to receive a total of 12 to 16 treatments. The goals of Ketamine treatment for depression are rapid recovery, stabilization, maintenance of effect and, if possible, transfer to more traditional oral medications. Ketamine maintenance is possible, if absolutely necessary.
