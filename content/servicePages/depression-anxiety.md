## GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER

best-psychiatrist-new-yorkGeneralized Anxiety Disorder, GAD, is characterized by a pattern of excessive worry,  even when there is little to provoke it . Sometimes, Anxiety is accompanied by the physical symptoms of muscle tension, headaches, insomnia and fatigue. Generalized Anxiety is often under diagnosed. Patients frequently do not seek help for GAD, because they see themselves as “worry warts”. Frequently, patients continue to function well despite GAD, but their quality of life suffers. Often, untreated GAD leads to alcohol or substance abuse, as patients seek relief by self-medicating their anxiety.

GAD can be effectively treated to full remission of symptoms. South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center can help GAD patients to improve their symptoms by expert Psychopharmacology and Hypnosis



## PANIC DISORDER

Panic Disorder is characterized by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear, accompanied by physical symptoms that may include chest pain, heart palpitations, skin tingling, shortness of breath, dizziness, or abdominal distress. People with Panic Disorder have feelings of terror that strike suddenly and repeatedly with no warning. Due to panic attacks, patients start avoiding activities that make panic attacks likely to occur, and some even become homebound.

South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center focuses on helping patients with Panic Disorder feel more in control. We believe that the fear of panic attacks can become more disabling then the panic attack itself. We help our patients to achieve control over Panic Disorder with the use of expert Psychopharmacology and relaxation techniques.



## SOCIAL PHOBIA

Social Phobia is a persistent and irrational fear of situations that may involve scrutiny or judgment by others in social situations. Patients with Social Phobia may appear to others as being very shy. However, Social Phobia may prevent individuals from attending social events, participating in public speaking and from forming important relationships. People with Social Phobia are at high risk for alcohol or other drug dependence, because they may come to rely on drinks or drugs to relax in social situations.

Although many people with Social Phobia realize that their fears about being with people are excessive or unreasonable, they are unable to overcome them on their own. South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center in Hewlett Long island can help patients overcome Social Phobia by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and expert Psychopharmacology.
