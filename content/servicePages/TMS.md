Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive treatment for Depression offered at South Shore Nueropsychiatric Center.

TMS uses magnetic stimulation of the brain to help control mood in adults with major Depression.

The procedure was cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2008 in patients who failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from one course of Pharmacotherapy (medication). For this reason, TMS is particularly helpful for people who have not experienced significant relief from antidepressant medications or who have difficulty with antidepressant side effects.

We at South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center have been treating patient with TMS therapy since April 2010.
