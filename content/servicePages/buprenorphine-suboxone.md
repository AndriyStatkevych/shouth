**South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center is a licensed and authorized Suboxone provider in Long Island, New York.**

We specialize in private, confidential, outpatient treatment of opioid/pain killer/alcohol abuse.



Due to the addictive properties of prescription pain killers, many patients progress from using them for pain, to using them to create a sensation of wellbeing. Misuse of prescription pain killers can easily progress to abuse and dependence.



It is important for patient’s dependent on opioids to receive proper treatment for their condition in order to regain purpose and function in their lives, as well as to reduce the risk of serious health-related issues. While there are many options available for treating opioid dependence, many involve a lengthy stay at a rehabilitation facility or other long-term programs. Motivated individuals with good social support in the community can be treated discretely at South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center on an outpatient basis.

## TREATMENT OPTIONS: 

**Buprenorphine/Suboxone treatment:** 

Dr. Fruitman will determine whether or not treatment with Buprenorphine is appropriate for you after a thorough evaluation of your condition, mental health history and overall health. 

Buprenorphine is first administered when an opioid-dependent person has abstained from using opioids for 12-24 hours and is beginning to experience symptoms of withdrawal. We will develop a customized treatment plan for each individual patient that takes into account their condition, history, and risk of relapse, among other factors. Following Dr. Fruitman’s treatment plan helps to improve the effectiveness of your treatment.

**Vivitrol injections:**

Opioid and alcohol dependence are chronic, relapsing illnesses that can be devastating both mentally and physically.  

Vivitrol for alcohol is used for patients who can abstain from alcohol in an outpatient setting prior to the initial treatment of vivitrol. Patients should not be actively drinking at the time of the initial vivitrol administration.  

Vivitrol for opioid use is used for the prevention of release in opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. You must top taking opioids before you start receiving vivitrol, to be fully effective, vivitrol should be used in conjunction with other alcohol/opioid treatments programs such as counseling.

**Antabuse:**

A once-daily medication used for alcohol abuse, Antabuse blocks the enzyme that is involved in processing alcohol.  This medication aids in the management of patients who want to remain in a state of enforced sobriety. 

It is important to note that patients must abstain from alcohol for at least 12 hours prior to starting this medication. Antabuse produces a sensitivity to alcohol which results in a highly unpleasant reaction when the patient drinks even the smallest amount of alcohol.
