**South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center is a licensed and authorized Suboxone provider in Long Island New York.**

We specialize in private, confidential, outpatient treatment of opiod/pain killer abuse. Frequently, patients start using prescription pain killers following surgery or child birth, or for painful conditions, like sciatica or migraine headaches.


Due to addictive properties of prescription pain killers, many patients progress from using them for pain to using them to create a sensation of wellbeing and tranquility. Misuse of prescription pain killers can easily progress to abuse and dependence.


It is important for patients dependent on opioids to receive proper treatment for their condition in order to regain purpose and function in their lives, as well as to reduce the risk of serious health-related issues. While there are many options available for treating opioid dependence, many involve a lengthy stay at a rehabilitation facility or other long-term programs. Motivated individuals with good social support in the community can be treated discretely at South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center on an outpatient basis.


If you are suffering from an opioid addiction but do not want to undergo in-patient rehabilitation or other intense forms of treatment, there may be an effective solution available for you in the form of Suboxone®, an FDA-approved medication for opioid dependence.


Dr. Fruitman combines Suboxone (Buprenorphine), a prescription medication used to treat the physical aspects of opioid dependence, with counseling sessions and treatment of the underlying Depression/Anxiety Disorders. Sometimes, patients are prescribed Suboxone (Buprenorphine) along with other medications.



## TREATMENT WITH SUBOXONE

Dr. Fruitman will determine whether or not treatment with Buprenorphine is appropriate for you after a thorough evaluation of your condition, mental health history and overall health. Buprenorphine is first administered when an opioid-dependent person has abstained from using opioids for 12-24 hours and is beginning to experience symptoms of withdrawal. Dr. Fruitman will develop a customized treatment plan for each individual patient that takes into account their condition history and risk of relapse, among other factors. Following Dr. Fruitman’s treatment plan helps to improve the effectiveness of your treatment.
