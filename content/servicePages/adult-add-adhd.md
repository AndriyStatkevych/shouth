## What is adult attention deficit disorder?

adult-add-hewlettMany adults have ADD/ADHD and don’t know they have it. ADD/ADHD is the second most common psychiatric illness of biological origin and affects approximately 4-5% of the population worldwide (as per WHO). Frequently, adults with ADD/ADHD experience challenges at work or school but compensate for them with quick, outside of the box thinking and the ability to hyper-focus for a short period of time.

* Common signs and symptoms of adult ADHD include:
* Procrastination
* Frequent lateness
* Poor concentration with tedious tasks
* Inability to refocus quickly when interrupted
* Frequent fender-bender auto-accidents
* Difficulty sitting in on job related meetings
* Disorganization
* Forgetfulness
* Frequent loss of phones, keys, and wallets
* Difficulty starting and/or finishing projects
* Moving from one task to another, being involved in too many projects simultaneously
* Time-management issues, over-estimating available time or time it takes to finish the task
* Making impulsive decisions, poor planning, impulsive spending
* Tendency to interrupt others

Not every person with ADD/ADHD has every symptom, nor do they experience symptoms to the same degree. Adult ADD/ADHD must be diagnosed by a Board Certified Psychiatrist. Dr. Edward Fruitman specializes in the treatment of  Adult ADD/ADHD in NYC and Long island.  If you have struggle at work and/or school with procrastination, lateness, completing routine boring tasks, and/or time management, call us to schedule an appointment for a comprehensive evaluation. With proper diagnosis and treatment, adult ADD/ADHD does not have to negatively impact an individual’s life.



## How is it different to childhood ADHD?

adhd-psychiatrist-new-yorkMany adults with ADD/ADHD exhibited some symptoms of ADD/ADHD in childhood, which went undiagnosed due to parental resistance and/or adequate school performance.

Symptoms of ADD/ADHD change with age. Hyperactivity and impulsivity can improve with age, while procrastination and time management issues may become more visible due to increased responsibility.  Adults with ADD/ADHD are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs, and in some cases, engage in risky sexual behaviors. A diagnosis of ADHD is frequently very liberating to a person who struggled all of their life with symptoms that they could not define or understand.



## Life Long Progression of ADD/ADHD

A common misconception is that ADHD affects only children.  In fact, 60% of children with ADHD may continue to have symptoms as adults. The average age of an Adult ADD/ADHD patient in treatment is 35.  ADD/ADHD is the most under-diagnosed and under-treated mental health problem (only 5% of diagnosed patients get proper treatment). It is not surprising that Adults with ADD/ADHD need the most help in their 20’s and 30’s: it is the time of life that is more professionally challenging.  Most young professionals do not have a choice which task they must perform themselves and which can be delegated.  Moreover, most young professionals do not control their work environment. Professionals can frequently ameliorate ADHD symptoms later in their career by adjusting their work environment, delegating tasks and getting assistants.



## ADHD Medications

Most ADHD symptoms improve safely, quickly and effectively with medications.  When patients experience the positive effect of medication for the first time, they feel profound relief.  The effect is so sudden and dramatic; it is frequently compared to the effect of putting on glasses and seeing clearly for the first time. Stimulants are believed to enhance the availability of the brain’s chemical messengers Dopamine and Norepinephrine.

The stimulants include medications like Ritalin, Concerta, Adderall, Adderall XR, Vyvanse, Focalin, Straterra, and others. As long as stimulant medications are used as prescribed, they can alleviate symptoms safely.  Some patients with family history of heart disease or history of cardiac anomalies may require a cardiogram (a routine part of initial evaluation). Our practice has a policy of prescribing stimulants only to patients who need stimulants to improve their productivity and to use longer-acting stimulants first, whenever possible. Other, non-FDA approved, but frequently used medications are Desipramine, Effexor, and Bupropion. Some patients may benefit from stimulant antidepressant medications and/or prescription vitamins.
