Though adolescent ADD/ADHD is incredibly common, the symptoms can be difficult to manage without both professional help and support from the school system. In today’s stressful classroom environment, the challenges faced by those with ADD/ADHD can lead to undue distress and anxiety. For that reason, we are committed to integrating all resources to promote the success of our patients.



Michelle Barnathan, LMHC, combines her experience as both a licensed school counselor and a psychotherapist to provide her patients with multifaceted support. By working closely with Dr. Fruitman, we are able to integrate medication management, counseling, and school advocacy. Due to Michelle’s experience, she is able to work with the school system to create a supportive environment. Depending on the patient’s needs, this may include setting up an IEP, obtaining IP3 Educational Accommodations, or speaking on a client’s behalf at a CSE meeting. Through our unique approach, we are able to promote our client’s success both at school and at home.



We work with each patient to develop an individualized care plan. We understand that everyone’s needs are different, so we tailor our approach to best serve our clients. An example treatment plan is:

		

+ Weekly counseling and study skills practice with Michelle Barnathan

+ Monthly medication management with Dr. Fruitman

+ Educational accommodations as necessary

Additional options include twice-weekly telecommunication sessions, behavioral therapy, or counseling sessions that include family members. Depending on the client’s needs, the treatment plan varies significantly.
