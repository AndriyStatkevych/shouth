Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive treatment for Depression offered at South Shore Neurospychiatric Center.

Neurostar uses transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to target key areas of the brain that are under active in people with depression. Although the exact cause of depression is unknown, the leading scientific theory is that it is caused by an imbalance of the brains neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers sent throughout the brain. 

The procedure was cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2008 in patients who failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from one course of Pharmacotherapy (medication). For this reason, TMS is particularly helpful for people who have not experienced significant relief from antidepressant medications or who have difficulty with antidepressant side effects.

We at South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center have been treating patient with TMS therapy since 2010.

## TMS PROCEDURE

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses a targeted pulsed magnetic field, similar to what is used in an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machine. While the patient is awake and alert, NeuroStar TMS Therapy stimulates areas of the brain that are underactive in depression.

This procedure is completely painless and noninvasive. TMS requires no anesthesia or sedation and patients are awake and alert during the procedure. Because no medications are administered, there are no systemic effects or cognitive after-effects (memory loss or ability to concentrate); therefore, patients can return immediately to regular activity.

Each treatment sessions takes approximately 30 minutes to perform, and patients can resume their regular activities immediately after each session. An effective course of treatment is 4-6 weeks long.



## TREATMENT

TMS Patients typically receive 20 to 30 treatments over four to six weeks, five times per week; with each treatment lasting approximately 37 minutes. The course of treatment varies according to each individual. An initial assessment will determine the appropriate dose of the magnetic pulse and the exact area of the brain the coil should target. As treatment progresses, the clinician will conduct periodic re-evaluations of the dose level and coil placement.

During a treatment session, the patient sits in a comfortable reclining chair similar to that found in a dentist’s office. A headset is applied to deliver the magnetic stimulation. Ear plugs are provided to decrease the loud clicks associated with each magnetic pulse and the patient is given the option of watching TV. During the procedure, the patient is monitored continuously to ensure correct positioning and comfort level.

South Shore Neuropsychiatric Center pioneered the technique of engaging the patient in Cognitive/Supportive Psychotherapy during the course of TMS treatments, administered by a trained clinician.



## ARE THERE RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS WITH TMS?

More than 10,000 treatments were safely performed during clinical trials. Patients reported no side effects like those associated with antidepressant medication (weight gain, dry mouth, drowsiness, sexual side effects, etc.), and no cognitive side effects. Scalp discomfort during the procedure is the most common side effect. TMS should not be used for patients with implanted metallic devices that include metal plates in the skull or aneurysm coils, clips or stents. Special precautions are recommended for individuals with implants, such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators.

## IS TMS COVERED BY INSURANCE?

Almost all major insurance providers authorize TMS. As an out-of-network provider, we’re able to negotiate single-case coverage for TMS with most private plans if the treatment is deemed medically necessary and patient meets clinical criteria. 

If insurance coverage isn’t an option, we can also work with you to develop an out-of-pocket payment plan to cover the cost of treatment. Contact us to learn more.
